# CType: "Domain Linkage Credential"

This CType links a domain to a DID.
It is usually not attested by a third party attester, but by the claiming DID itself.
By attesting to the claim, the DID signals that it agrees to being linked to the domain name contained in the claim.

This CType is used for the [Well-Known DID Configuration](https://identity.foundation/.well-known/resources/did-configuration/).
You can learn more about [how this CType might be used in the KILT Documentation](https://docs.kilt.io/docs/develop/dApp/well-known-did-config)
